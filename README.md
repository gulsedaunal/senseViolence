# senseViolence 

This is a transfer learning project to label videos for violent content. I worked on this at Insight Data Science in June 2017.
A brief demo on the project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i08eafSk9P28yesXpWIeJvGMoz2fd9vaSy_9YGuN8pE/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g228aa4b4c8_0_1
